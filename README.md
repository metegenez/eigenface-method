# Introduction

In this repo, we design a face recognition system using the Eigenface approach. An eigenface is the name given to a set of eigenvectors when used in the computer vision problem of human face recognition. We conduct a set of experiments.

## Reconstruction

It is possible to reconstruct the original face image, up to a certain quality, from the Eigenface features. To reconstruct a face
image from Eigenface features E i (i.e., Eigenface coefficients).
